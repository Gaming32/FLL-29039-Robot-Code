Robot Design
============

Our underlying design goal was to keep the robot small and simple because it is
more efficient. The relatively small body is nice because it allows us to easily
move between the mission models on the table and have less chance to run into
them. We have one single moving part, besides the wheels, which is a simple arm
with various attachments for different sets of missions. `Insert Image Here`

\# Sensors + The Color Sensor is used to find lines that provide us with our
position. + The Gyro Sensor is used extensively to keep us perfectly straight. +
The Ultrasonic Sensor is used as the positioning device in Solar Panel Array and
Space Travel. It also just looks cool!
