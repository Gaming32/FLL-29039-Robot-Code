# Evolution of Strategy for Escape Velocity
+ We constructed a simple arm of parallel beams with no extra weight and a 1:3 gear ratio.<a href="#gear-ratio"><sup>[1]</sup></a> We thought that speed only was what was needed to make the ship launch.
+ We realized that weight was needed in addition to speed to make the ship launch, so we mad a weight that was made of standard Legos and bulky.
+ We compacted the weight's width by taking some of the pieces and putting them up on the other side, hugging the arm. (see <a href="#fig-a">Figure A</a>)
+ We changed the gear ratio of the arm to 1:1.<a href="#gear-ratio"><sup>[1]</sup></a>
+ We swapped the weight out for a new weight made with studless Technic beams and frames because we thought that we weren't allowed to use regular Lego bricks.
+ We then braced the arm so that it didn't twist when coming down.
+ Shortened it so that it didn't pass the 1 foot limit
+ Finally, we added an extension that stuck up off the weight when the arm was down so that the weight would be just a little heavier. (see <a href="#fig-b">Figure B</a>)

<a id="gear-ratio"><sup>[1]</sup></a>Gear ratios represent the amount that speed and torque change with it being the follower gear to the driver gear. For example, a 1:1 gear ratio has less speed and more torque than a 1:3 gear ratio.
